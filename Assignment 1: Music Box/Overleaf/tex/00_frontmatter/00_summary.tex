\chapter*{Summary}

This is a set of guidelines for writing the report. This document may also be used as a template for the reports. \\
The Summary is the report's "commercial". After reading the summary, the reader should understand quite well what has been done. The most important results and conclusions should be reported, hence it should be very similar to the Conclusions chapter.
