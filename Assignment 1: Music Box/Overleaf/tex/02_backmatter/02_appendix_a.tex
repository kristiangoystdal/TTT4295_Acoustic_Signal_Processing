\chapter{Appendix}
The appendix should contain observations, calculations and results that are too long to be included in the previous parts. Data sheets, source code, and things like that can also be included here. 

The appendix often includes extra material which works as a compliment to the report for those who want deeper insights into derivations, assumptions made and for those who want to look closer at the results. Raw data might in some cases be possible to include, and might be valuable for the reader.
