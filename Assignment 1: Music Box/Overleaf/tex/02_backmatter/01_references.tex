\chapter{References}

 The References chapter should name \textbf{all} literature that has been used in the assignment. If you have used an equation from a book or a standard {\em or the assignment text}, make sure to cite it. To cite a reference, use square brackets, as in \cite{Nilsson}. There are many good ways to list your sources, pick one bibliography style and stick with it for all the sources in your report. 

Literature references usually look like this (see next page): {[}Ref.nr.{]} author, title, publisher, place, year, pages: {[}1{]} Nilsson, James W., Electric circuits, Fourth edition, Addison Wesley, New York, 1993, 923 p.

\begin{thebibliography}{1}
\bibitem{Nilsson}Nilsson, James W., Electric circuits, Fourth edition, Addison Wesley, New York, 1993, 923 p. 

\end{thebibliography}
