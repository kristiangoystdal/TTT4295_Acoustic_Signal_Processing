\section{Segmented Audio Signal}

The audio signal was successfully segmented into individual notes based on the manually selected time splits. Each segment corresponds to a distinct note played by the music box. As seen in \autoref{fig:time_plot_segment_1}, the waveform of Segment 1 clearly shows the onset and decay of the note, and shows that there note is allowed to die out before another note occurs. This segmentation allows for isolated analysis of each note's frequency content.

\section{FFT Analysis of Music Box Recording}

\subsection{Segmented FFT Analysis}

If we look at the FFT of Segment 1 in \autoref{fig:fft_segment_1}, we can see that the fundamental frequency is approximately 1106.56 Hz.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Overharmonic Peaks Identification}

Also as seen in \autoref{fig:fft_segment_1}, the harmonic peaks are identified by looking for peaks in the FFT magnitude spectrum that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. The deviation of the actual harmonic peaks from the perfect harmonic frequencies is calculated in cents and is summarized in Table \ref{tab:deviation_segment_1}. We can see that the deviation increases with higher harmonics, indicating that the music box's tuning is not perfectly harmonic.

\begin{table}[ht]

    \caption{Deviation of Harmonic Peaks from Perfect Harmonics for Segment 1}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        \hline
        Harmonic & Actual Frequency (Hz) & Deviation (cents) \\
        \hline
        1st (Fundamental) & 1106.56 & 0 \\
        2nd & 2213.12 & 0 \\
        3rd & 3319.68 & -5.85 \\
        4th & 4426.24 & -11.73 \\
        5th & 5532.80 & -17.61 \\

\section{Note Identification and Melody Extraction}

Using \autoref{eq:note_freq}, the identified peak frequencies were mapped to their corresponding musical notes. The notes were then categorized into melody and bass based on their frequencies. Notes above middle C (approximately 261.63 Hz) were classified as melody, while those below were classified as bass.

The melody frequencies and their corresponding notes are summarized in \autoref{tab:melody_freq_notes}. Also the deviation in cents from the ideal frequency is included, which shows how well the music box is tuned.

The bass frequencies and their corresponding notes are summarized in \autoref{tab:bass_freq_notes}. The bass primarily consists of notes in the 1st and 2nd octaves, indicating a lower pitch range typical for bass lines. The deviation from the ideal frequency for each note is also shown in cents.
