\chapter{Discussions}
This chapter could either be its own chapter or be merged with the \ref{ch:Results} chapter. If there is a separate Discussions chapter, then the Results chapter should not have any discussion of the results.

Whether in the Results chapter or in a separate Discussions chapter, than measurement results should be commented, with an analysis and an evaluation of the results and measurement data with the aim of drawing a conclusion. If possible, the sources of error should be brought up and their possible effect on the results considered. If relevant, deviations should be quantified and given in percent.
