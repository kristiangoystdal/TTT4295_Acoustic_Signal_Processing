\chapter{Conclusions}

The analysis of the music box recording using FFT has successfully identified the fundamental frequencies and their harmonics. The melody and bass notes were extracted, and their tuning accuracy was evaluated by calculating the deviation from ideal frequencies in cents.

Overall, the results indicate that the music box is quite well-tuned, with most notes falling within acceptable limits of deviation. However, some outliers were identified, particularly in the higher register, which may be more susceptible to manufacturing imperfections. Further investigation into the mechanical properties of the music box could provide insights into these tuning discrepancies and inform potential improvements in design or construction.
