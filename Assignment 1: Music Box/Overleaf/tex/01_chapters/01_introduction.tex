\chapter{Introduction}

This report presents the analysis of a music box recording using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to identify the fundamental frequencies and their harmonics. The goal is to extract the melody and bass notes played by the music box, and to evaluate the tuning accuracy of the instrument by calculating the deviation of the harmonic peaks from their ideal frequencies in cents.
