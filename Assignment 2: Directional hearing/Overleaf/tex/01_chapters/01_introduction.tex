This report presents the implementation and evaluation of Head-Related Impulse Response (HRIR) and Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) models based on a simple rigid sphere approximation. The main objective of this report is to simulate how sound is perceived from different directions by using interaural time differences (ITD) and frequency-dependent filtering effects caused by the head.
